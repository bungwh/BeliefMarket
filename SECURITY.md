## FHE Privacy
- Vote weights are encrypted client-side
- No plaintext vote data on-chain
- Decryption requires threshold authorization

## Smart Contract Security
- Reentrancy protection
- Access control for admin functions
- Safe math operations

## Reporting Vulnerabilities
Please report security issues to the repository maintainers.
