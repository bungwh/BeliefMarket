# Gas Optimization Notes

## FHE Operations
- FHE operations are gas-intensive
- Batch operations where possible
- Minimize on-chain FHE computations

## Storage Optimization
- Use packed structs
- Minimize storage writes
- Use memory for temporary data

## Future Improvements
- Implement lazy evaluation
- Optimize loop iterations
- Consider layer 2 deployment
